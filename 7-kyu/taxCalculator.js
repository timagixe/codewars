- TITLE:
Tax Calculator

- DESCRIPTION:
Write a function to calculate compound tax using the following table:
For $10 and under, the tax rate should be 10%.
For $20 and under, the tax rate on the first $10 is %10, and the tax on the rest is 7%.
For $30 and under, the tax rate on the first $10 is still %10, the rate for the next $10 is still 7%, and everything else is 5%.
Tack on an additional 3% for the portion of the total above $30.
Return 0 for invalid input(anything that's not a positive real number).
Examples:
An input of 10, should return 1 (1 is 10% of 10)
An input of 21, should return 1.75 (10% of 10 + 7% of 10 + 5% of 1)
* Note that the returned value should be rounded to the nearest penny.
